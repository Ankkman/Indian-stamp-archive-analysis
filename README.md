# ðŸ“¬ Indian Postage Stamp Archive â€“ Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores a dataset of around 3000 official Indian postage stamps issued between 1962 and 2025.  
The dataset was created from scratch and includes **title, denomination, category (up to 2000), date of issue, and image links**.

The main goal is to study historical trends, category patterns, and denomination changes in Indian stamps.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Performed
1. **Stamps per Year** â€“ Trend of issues from 1962 to 2025.
2. **Stamps per Decade** â€“ Long-term growth patterns.
3. **Category Analysis (â‰¤2000)** â€“ Most common stamp themes before 2000.
4. **Denomination Analysis** â€“ Distribution and most frequent values.
5. **Top Issuing Years** â€“ Years with the highest number of stamp issues.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Steady growth from the 1960s, peaking in the 2010s.
- Thematic and Event categories dominated pre-2000 stamps.
- Low-value denominations (like 15 nP) were common in earlier decades.
- 2017 had the highest number of stamps issued in a single year.

## ðŸš€ Future Work
- Build an interactive web-based stamp explorer.
- Use NLP to predict categories for post-2000 stamps.
- Add image-based classification for stamps.
